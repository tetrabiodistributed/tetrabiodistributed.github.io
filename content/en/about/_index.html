Project Tetra is a sample site using the <a href="https://github.com/google/docsy">Docsy</a> Hugo theme that shows what it can do and provides you with a template site structure. It’s designed for you to clone and edit as much as you like. See the different sections of the documentation and site for more ideas.

<h1 class="text-center">Our Philosophy: 
Tetra is a device that is built to save lives. The principles of how this team works are based on respectful, collaborative, and open source development. We are honest in what we do, publicly publishing our work step by step. We seek to provide high quality ventilator splitting that meets the rigor of FDA medical device standards, while remaining flexible and accessible enough of a design to be built with open source electronic components, 3D printers, and hand tools. We make our device safe through careful and thoughtful design choices based on feedback from medical professionals. 


What Is Tetra: 
Project Tetra seeks to add two to four patients to a single ventilator to increase the treatment capacity of hospitals, while addressing concerns of tidal flow control, respiratory virus spread, and ethical choices. The device is a ventilator splitter that has a central hub with display, arms for each patient, and connectors for the ventilator. Tetra is meant to be used in a last resort scenario, when hospitals are at capacity and need to make decisions about who can receive ventilation and who cannot. We see a need to provide a device that can safely split air to increase the capacity of hospitals to provide ventilation to patients in need.
  
Who Are We:
We are a group that originated as volunteers in March 2020 from Helpful Engineering’s Slack channel, and formed in response to a need for better solutions for hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The team is composed of people with backgrounds in design, engineering, medicine, management, and science fields. We believe in the power of technology to improve people’s lives and want to use our skills to help others.
